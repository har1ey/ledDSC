# DIY Astronomy tool
This is a multipurpose tool meant to aid in the use of telescopes, it features:

* Zeroable Compass (not tilt compensated), with 0.1 degree resolution. Stores offset to EEPROM.
* Zeroable Clinometer with 0.1 degree resolution. Stores offset to EEPROM.
* Zeroable 2 axis digital Level with 0.1 degree resolution.  Stores offsets to EEPROM.
* Brightness control.

These can be useful for leveling a telescope and for doing basic polar alignment, or as a very simple alt-azimuth display of telescope position.

Here is a 6 minute youtube video describing how it works:

## Hardware used:
* Arduino Mega328 development board (UNO, Pro or similar). The one in the video is a Pro mini 5V 16Mhz
* HMC5883 sensor module, I used the GY-271 variant.
* MMA8452 accelerometer, I used the GY-45 variant.
* 7 Segment, 8 Digit, MAX72XX controlled, 5 Wire LED display.
* KY-040 Rotary encoder, for user input (selecting mode, zeroing the compass and inclinometer, adjusting display brightness)

## Arduino pinout:
* SDA = A4   (4.7K pullup to VCC recommended)
* SCL = A5   (4.7K pullup to VCC recommended)

## MMA8452 pinout:
* SDA, SCL and GND: matching the Arduino
* VCC (from Arduino) to VCC_IN, not to the 3V3  pin
* SAO (address select) to GND.
* When used as a digital level, the accelerometer is meant to be used hosizontal (Z axis pointing to the sky).
* When used as inclinometer or DSC, the acelerometer is meant to be used vertical, with the Z axis pointing to the horizon.

## HMC5883 (or GY271) pinout:
* SDA, SCL, VCC and GND: matching the Arduino
* DRDY pin disconnected
* The HMC5883 is meant to be used on a permanently horizontal position (not attached to the telescope tube)

## MAX72XX LED Display:
* VCC and GND: matching the Arduino
* DIN (Data In) connected to Arduino pin 12
* CLK connected to Arduino pin 11
* LOAD (CS) connected to Arduino pin 10

## KY-040 Rotary Encoder:
* CLK connected to Arduino pin 2
* DT connected to Arduino pin 3
* SW connected to Arduino pin 4, and through a 10K pullup to VCC.
* VCC (sometimes labeled "+" connected to Arduino VCC
* GND connected to Arduino GND
